This was a project done from the Odin Project course. It was origanally just a game that was played in the console by proming the user for "rock, paper, or scissors". It had taken the input, made sure it was all lowercase, and if not it would repromt until a valid chose was enterd. It would then randomize a computer choice and then take the two and play a round. Once the Player or Comupter had reached 5 it would give a winner. I have updated this to now have a landing page that gets rewritten with java script to create the playing page. This allows the user to select rock, paper, or scissors by clicking a button. It updates the score, and the choices. Once the score reaches 5, it alerts a winner and resets the game.
